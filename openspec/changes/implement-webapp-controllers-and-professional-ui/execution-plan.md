# Workflow Implementation Execution Plan

## Summary

This document defines the complete execution plan for achieving 100% workflow coverage as specified in [workflow-coverage-matrix.md](workflow-coverage-matrix.md). The plan addresses:

1. **Not Started workflows**: Initial baseline had 11 gaps; currently reduced with multiple rows moved to Covered/In Progress
2. **In Progress workflows**: Initial baseline had 14 workflows; currently focused on closing remaining validation/evidence gaps
3. **Navigation**: UI navigation overhaul with role-based discoverability
4. **Role hardening**: Migration from generic role attributes to explicit business roles

## Current Progress Snapshot

### Completed in implementation sessions

- Authorization policy baseline in [`WebApp/Setup/IdentitySetupExtensions.cs`](WebApp/Setup/IdentitySetupExtensions.cs)
- Role-aware navigation overhaul in [`WebApp/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml`](WebApp/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml)

- Company profile workflow (`COMP-01`) via [`Profile()`](WebApp/Controllers/CompanySettingsController.cs:22) and [`WebApp/Views/CompanySettings/Profile.cshtml`](WebApp/Views/CompanySettings/Profile.cshtml)
- Company deadline workflow (`COMP-08`) via [`Deadlines()`](WebApp/Controllers/WeeklyMenusController.cs:200), [`UpdateDeadline()`](WebApp/Controllers/WeeklyMenusController.cs:215), and [`WebApp/Views/WeeklyMenus/Deadlines.cshtml`](WebApp/Views/WeeklyMenus/Deadlines.cshtml)
- Nutrition maintenance workflow (`COMP-06`) via [`Nutrition(Guid?)`](WebApp/Controllers/RecipesController.cs:61), [`Nutrition(Guid, RecipeNutritionEditViewModel)`](WebApp/Controllers/RecipesController.cs:101), and [`WebApp/Views/Recipes/Nutrition.cshtml`](WebApp/Views/Recipes/Nutrition.cshtml)
- Tenant role-assignment hardening (`COMP-14`) via [`WebApp/Controllers/CompanyUsersController.cs`](WebApp/Controllers/CompanyUsersController.cs)
- Billing overview workflow (`SYS-03`) via [`WebApp/Controllers/InvoicesController.cs`](WebApp/Controllers/InvoicesController.cs) and [`WebApp/Views/Invoices/Index.cshtml`](WebApp/Views/Invoices/Index.cshtml)
- Build validation passing with [`dotnet build`](WebApp/WebApp.csproj)

### Remaining focus

- Close `In Progress` rows to `Covered` with explicit verification evidence
- Complete remaining `Not Started` rows (currently concentrated in `COMP-04`, `COMP-05`, `SYS-01`, `SYS-02`)
- Finish broader plan-cap checks for `COMP-15` beyond delivery-zone caps

## Phase 1: Establish Role-Policy Baseline

Status: ✅ Implemented

### 1.1 Define Canonical Business Roles

| Role | Scope | Typical Permissions |
|------|-------|---------------------|
| Customer | Customer | View/subscribe to plans, manage preferences, submit selections, track deliveries |
| CompanyOwner | Company | Full company administration including billing, settings, user management |
| CompanyAdmin | Company | Company configuration, recipes, menus, delivery zones, users |
| CompanyManager | Company | Recipe management, menu planning, delivery windows, complaint escalation |
| CompanyEmployee | Company | Delivery tracking, attempt logging, complaint handling (view-only escalation) |
| SystemAdmin | System | Cross-tenant company management, system settings, impersonation, analytics |
| SystemBilling | System | Subscription plans, tiers, billing, invoices |
| SystemSupport | System | View-only support access, ticketing, tenant diagnostics |

### 1.2 Authorization Policy Setup

```csharp
// Policies to add in Program.cs / service configuration
builder.Services.AddAuthorization(options =>
{
    options.AddPolicy("CustomerAccess", policy => 
        policy.RequireRole("Customer"));
    options.AddPolicy("CompanyAdmin", policy => 
        policy.RequireRole("CompanyOwner", "CompanyAdmin"));
    options.AddPolicy("CompanyManager", policy => 
        policy.RequireRole("CompanyOwner", "CompanyAdmin", "CompanyManager"));
    options.AddPolicy("CompanyEmployee", policy => 
        policy.RequireRole("CompanyOwner", "CompanyAdmin", "CompanyManager", "CompanyEmployee"));
    options.AddPolicy("SystemAdmin", policy => 
        policy.RequireRole("SystemAdmin"));
    options.AddPolicy("SystemBilling", policy => 
        policy.RequireRole("SystemAdmin", "SystemBilling"));
    options.AddPolicy("SystemSupport", policy => 
        policy.RequireRole("SystemAdmin", "SystemSupport"));
});
```

### 1.3 Controller Role Migration Matrix

| Controller | Current Role | Target Role(s) | Policy |
|------------|--------------|----------------|--------|
| CompaniesController | admin | SystemAdmin | SystemAdmin |
| CompanySettingsController | user | CompanyOwner, CompanyAdmin | CompanyAdmin |
| CompanyUsersController | user | CompanyOwner, CompanyAdmin | CompanyAdmin |
| BoxesController | (varies) | CompanyAdmin, CompanyManager | CompanyManager |
| BoxPricesController | (varies) | CompanyOwner, CompanyAdmin | CompanyAdmin |
| DeliveryZonesController | (varies) | CompanyOwner, CompanyAdmin | CompanyAdmin |
| DeliveryWindowsController | (varies) | CompanyAdmin, CompanyManager | CompanyManager |
| RecipesController | (varies) | CompanyAdmin, CompanyManager | CompanyManager |
| DietaryCategoriesController | (varies) | CompanyAdmin, CompanyManager | CompanyManager |
| WeeklyMenusController | (varies) | CompanyAdmin, CompanyManager | CompanyManager |
| MealSubscriptionsController | (varies) | Customer | CustomerAccess |
| CustomerPreferencesController | (varies) | Customer | CustomerAccess |
| CustomerExclusionsController | (varies) | Customer | CustomerAccess |
| MealSelectionsController | (varies) | Customer | CustomerAccess |
| DeliveriesController | (varies) | Customer, CompanyEmployee | Mixed* |
| QualityComplaintsController | (varies) | Customer, CompanyEmployee | Mixed* |
| DeliveryAttemptsController | (varies) | CompanyEmployee | CompanyEmployee |
| AnalyticsController | (varies) | SystemAdmin | SystemAdmin |
| SystemSettingsController | (varies) | SystemAdmin | SystemAdmin |
| SupportTicketsController | (varies) | SystemSupport, SystemAdmin | SystemSupport |
| SupportAccessController | (varies) | SystemSupport | SystemSupport |
| SupportImpersonationController | (varies) | SystemAdmin | SystemAdmin |
| PlatformSubscriptionsController | user | CompanyOwner, CompanyAdmin | CompanyAdmin |
| PlatformSubscriptionTiersController | user | SystemAdmin, SystemBilling | SystemBilling |

*Controllers serving both Customer and Company views need role-based action filters or separate authorization per action.

## Phase 2: Navigation Overhaul

Status: ✅ Implemented (with helper extraction deferred as non-blocking refactor)

### 2.1 Shared Layout (_Layout.cshtml) Navigation Structure

```
[Home]

[Customer View] (dropdown, visible if User.IsInRole("Customer"))
  - Discover Plans (CUST-01) → /MealPlans
  - My Subscriptions (CUST-02/03) → /MealSubscriptions
  - Dietary Preferences (CUST-04) → /CustomerPreferences
  - Ingredient Exclusions (CUST-05) → /CustomerExclusions
  - Weekly Menus (CUST-06) → /WeeklyMenus
  - Meal Selections (CUST-07) → /MealSelections
  - My Deliveries (CUST-11) → /Deliveries
  - Quality Complaints (CUST-12) → /QualityComplaints

[Company View] (dropdown, visible if any company role)
  - Company Settings (COMP-01) → /CompanySettings
  - Box Sizes (COMP-02) → /Boxes
  - Pricing (COMP-03) → /BoxPrices
  - Dietary Categories (COMP-04) → /DietaryCategories
  - Recipe Pool (COMP-05) → /Recipes
  - Weekly Menus (COMP-07) → /WeeklyMenus
  - Selection Deadlines (COMP-08) → /WeeklyMenus/Deadlines
  - Delivery Zones (COMP-09) → /DeliveryZones
  - Delivery Windows (COMP-10) → /DeliveryWindows

  - Companies (SYS-01) → /Companies
  - Subscription Plans (SYS-02) → /PlatformSubscriptionTiers
  - Billing & Invoices (SYS-03) → /Invoices
  - System Settings (SYS-04) → /SystemSettings
  - Analytics (SYS-05) → /Analytics
  - Impersonation (SYS-06) → /SupportImpersonation
  - Support Access (SYS-07) → /SupportAccess
  - Support Tickets (SYS-08) → /SupportTickets

[Root] (dropdown, visible if User.IsInRole("root"))
  - Users → /Root/Users

[Language] [Login/Logout]
```

### 2.2 Navigation Helper Requirements

Create `WebApp/Helpers/NavigationHelper.cs` with:
- `bool HasCustomerAccess(ClaimsPrincipal user)`
- `bool HasCompanyAccess(ClaimsPrincipal user)`
- `bool HasSystemAccess(ClaimsPrincipal user)`
- Extension methods for role checking in views

Status: core navigation is implemented directly in [`_Layout.cshtml`](WebApp/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml); helper extraction is optional refactoring and not blocking coverage.

## Phase 5: Role and Tenant Hardening Sweep

For each controller, verify:
1. `[Authorize]` attributes use explicit business roles or policies
2. Every action validates tenant context (GetCurrentCompanyId pattern)
3. Service calls pass companyId for tenant-scoped methods
4. No direct repository access from controllers (use BLL services)
5. Forbidden/NotFound handling is consistent

## Phase 6: UI Quality Pass

- [ ] Consistent form shells across all new views
- [ ] Validation summary placement
- [ ] Empty states for list views
- [ ] Action bars with proper permissions
- [ ] Responsive tables
- [ ] Keyboard navigation test
- [ ] Focus states and contrast

## Phase 7: Evidence Closure

For each row marked Covered:
1. Add evidence links to controller, service, view files
2. Verify role enforcement matches matrix
3. Verify tenant scope matches matrix
4. Document feedback patterns
5. Update matrix Status to "Covered"
